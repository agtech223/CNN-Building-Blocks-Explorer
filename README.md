## üìò About Convolutional Neural Networks

CNNs are at the heart of many computer vision applications, from object detection to image classification. They consist of various types of layers, each playing a unique role in processing and understanding visual data. Here's a quick overview of the operations this app lets you explore:

- **Convolution**: Extracts features by sliding filters over the image.
- **Batch Normalization**: Normalizes data across the batch to stabilize training.
- **Transpose Convolution**: Upsamples data, often used in tasks like image segmentation.
- **Max Pooling**: Downsamples data by selecting maximum values within each region.

Experimenting with these layers can deepen your understanding of how CNNs work!
